Different As Black And WhiteI dont understand why cant you see just what your yelling is doing to meopen your eyes take a look you used to read me like a book but times have changed as they tend to do and my life is turning into a zoo tears fall hard my head starts to pound and all at once my heart hits the ground I dont know what i did to make you think i cant do anything right for lately it seems our hearts and our dreams are as different as black and white
